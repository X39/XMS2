Changed default value of X39_MS2_var_triageState from -1 to 0.
Because default should be no state.

I think that -1 is unnecessary in arma 3 because you have getValue with could output the default value.
Also if a getValie is in 2 places build a function that you call instead. That way you dont have to change default value everywhere. 
Only in the Getfile.Even init for variables is unnecessary.

Added: Display will close if there is no actions to display.

Hey!
So I have been working on this now for a couple of days and seriously some things are really good with the project.
But some other things are really broken, beyond repair and I was hoping that some bugs that we found would be just to fix a little.
But its really broken, like the blackout system, its really broken the entire thing and it needs to be re written and I dont have time to rewrite entire 
sections of code. And our group is talking about changing medicalsystem.

Tips: 
#1 Use the getValue with default value, just in one place not 100 different places (easier to change smaller things)
#2 use a correct default value for example "X39_MS2_var_triageState" was default -1 but should the default value be 0 because default value on a soldier is Not hurt or no status.
Dont make it more complicated, initiate everything, default value that is not -1 or so, use the default value you want, like default for blood is 60000 not -1.
use variables for the values aswell so you just assign value in one place then all other code uses that number.
#3 As above all important numbers should be in one place and the entire other code is refering to that place (minimizing bugs alot of bugs and easier to tweek).

Hopefully the changes i made is not all bad but you think some are good aswell :)
